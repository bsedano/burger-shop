# Run the yarn or npm command on the terminal with the project folder open, then yarn or npm will download all dependencies

# After installing all needed dependencies, run yarn start and wait a moment, then the application will open on your default browser.

# If you want to run the application on a different port, you can use the --port flag.

# Application was made using TypeScript and React, Axios for API requests, ContextApi for managing global states, ChakraUI for styling and component creation, yup and hookform for form validation and Toasfity for notifications.

# Also, I created my own api using json-server and deploying it to heroku.
# Link to the application: https://burger-shop-bsedano.vercel.app/
