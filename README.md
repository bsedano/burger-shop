# Run the yarn or npm command on the terminal with the project folder open, then yarn or npm will download all dependencies

# After installing all needed dependencies, run yarn start and wait a moment, then the application will open on your default browser.

# If you want to run the application on a different port, you can use the --port flag.

# Application was made using Typescript, ContextApi to manage global states, Axios to make API requests and ChakraUI to style and create components.

# Also, I created my own api using json-server and deploying it to heroku.
